SUM Solutions
Find the total amount of poster_qty paper ordered in the orders table.

SELECT SUM(poster_qty) AS total_poster_sales
FROM orders;
Find the total amount of standard_qty paper ordered in the orders table.

SELECT SUM(standard_qty) AS total_standard_sales
FROM orders;
Find the total dollar amount of sales using the total_amt_usd in the orders table.

SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd) AS total_dollar_sales
FROM orders;
Find the total amount for each individual order that was spent on standard and gloss paper in the orders table. This should give a dollar amount for each order in the table. 

Notice, this solution did not use an aggregate.

SELECT standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd AS total_standard_gloss
FROM orders;
Though the price/standard_qty paper varies from one order to the next. I would like this ratio across all of the sales made in the orders table.

Notice, this solution used both an aggregate and our mathematical operators

SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd)/SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_price_per_unit
FROM orders;


Solutions: MIN, MAX, and AVERAGE
When was the earliest order ever placed?
SELECT MIN(occurred_at) 
FROM orders;
Try performing the same query as in question 1 without using an aggregation function. 

SELECT occurred_at 
FROM orders 
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 1;
When did the most recent (latest) web_event occur?
SELECT MAX(occurred_at)
FROM web_events;
Try to perform the result of the previous query without using an aggregation function.
SELECT occurred_at
FROM web_events
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
Find the mean (AVERAGE) amount spent per order on each paper type, as well as the mean amount of each paper type purchased per order. Your final answer should have 6 values - one for each paper type for the average number of sales, as well as the average amount.
SELECT AVG(standard_qty) mean_standard, AVG(gloss_qty) mean_gloss, 
           AVG(poster_qty) mean_poster, AVG(standard_amt_usd) mean_standard_usd, 
           AVG(gloss_amt_usd) mean_gloss_usd, AVG(poster_amt_usd) mean_poster_usd
FROM orders;
Via the video, you might be interested in how to calculate the MEDIAN. Though this is more advanced than what we have covered so far try finding - what is the MEDIAN total_usd spent on all orders? Note, this is more advanced than the topics we have covered thus far to build a general solution, but we can hard code a solution in the following way.
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT total_amt_usd
      FROM orders
      ORDER BY total_amt_usd
      LIMIT 3457) AS Table1
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 2;
Since there are 6912 orders - we want the average of the 3457 and 3456 order amounts when ordered. This is the average of 2483.16 and 2482.55. This gives the median of 2482.855. This obviously isn't an ideal way to compute. If we obtain new orders, we would have to change the limit. SQL didn't even calculate the median for us. The above used a SUBQUERY, but you could use any method to find the two necessary values, and then you just need the average of them.


GROUP BY
Which account (by name) placed the earliest order? Your solution should have the account name and the date of the order.
SELECT a.name, o.occurred_at
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 1;
Find the total sales in usd for each account. You should include two columns - the total sales for each company's orders in usd and the company name.
SELECT a.name, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name;
Via what channel did the most recent (latest) web_event occur, which account was associated with this web_event? Your query should return only three values - the date, channel, and account name.
SELECT w.occurred_at, w.channel, a.name
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON w.account_id = a.id 
ORDER BY w.occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
Find the total number of times each type of channel from the web_events was used. Your final table should have two columns - the channel and the number of times the channel was used.
SELECT w.channel, COUNT(*)
FROM web_events w
GROUP BY w.channel
Who was the primary contact associated with the earliest web_event?
SELECT a.primary_poc
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = w.account_id
ORDER BY w.occurred_at
LIMIT 1;
What was the smallest order placed by each account in terms of total usd. Provide only two columns - the account name and the total usd. Order from smallest dollar amounts to largest.
SELECT a.name, MIN(total_amt_usd) smallest_order
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY smallest_order;
Sort of strange we have a bunch of orders with no dollars. We might want to look into those. 

Find the number of sales reps in each region. Your final table should have two columns - the region and the number of sales_reps. Order from fewest reps to most reps.
SELECT r.name, COUNT(*) num_reps
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
ORDER BY num_reps;

Solutions: GROUP BY Part II
For each account, determine the average amount of each type of paper they purchased across their orders. Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average spent on each of the paper types.
SELECT a.name, AVG(o.standard_qty) avg_stand, AVG(o.gloss_qty) avg_gloss, AVG(o.poster_qty) avg_post
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name;
For each account, determine the average amount spent per order on each paper type. Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average amount spent on each paper type.
SELECT a.name, AVG(o.standard_amt_usd) avg_stand, AVG(o.gloss_amt_usd) avg_gloss, AVG(o.poster_amt_usd) avg_post
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name;
Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each sales rep. Your final table should have three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.
SELECT s.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) num_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name, w.channel
ORDER BY num_events DESC;
Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each region. Your final table should have three columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.
SELECT r.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) num_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name, w.channel
ORDER BY num_events DESC;



DISTINCT
Solutions: DISTINCT
Use DISTINCT to test if there are any accounts associated with more than one region.

The below two queries have the same number of resulting rows (351), so we know that every account is associated with only one region. If each account was associated with more than one region, the first query should have returned more rows than the second query.

SELECT a.id as "account id", r.id as "region id", 
a.name as "account name", r.name as "region name"
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id;
and

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM accounts;
Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?

Actually all of the sales reps have worked on more than one account. The fewest number of accounts any sales rep works on is 3. There are 50 sales reps, and they all have more than one account. Using DISTINCT in the second query assures that all of the sales reps are accounted for in the first query.

SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY num_accounts;
and

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM sales_reps;


HAVING CLAUSE
Solutions: HAVING
How many of the sales reps have more than 5 accounts that they manage?

SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY num_accounts;
and technically, we can get this using a SUBQUERY as shown below. This same logic can be used for the other queries, but this will not be shown.

SELECT COUNT(*) num_reps_above5
FROM(SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
     FROM accounts a
     JOIN sales_reps s
     ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
     GROUP BY s.id, s.name
     HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
     ORDER BY num_accounts) AS Table1;
How many accounts have more than 20 orders?


SELECT a.id, a.name, COUNT(*) num_orders

LIMIT 10;
All of the top 10 are direct.


DATE FUNCTIONS
Solutions: Working With DATEs
Find the sales in terms of total dollars for all orders in each year, ordered from greatest to least. Do you notice any trends in the yearly sales totals?


 SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
 FROM orders
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC;
When we look at the yearly totals, you might notice that 2013 and 2017 have much smaller totals than all other years. If we look further at the monthly data, we see that for 2013 and 2017 there is only one month of sales for each of these years (12 for 2013 and 1 for 2017). Therefore, neither of these are evenly represented. Sales have been increasing year over year, with 2016 being the largest sales to date. At this rate, we might expect 2017 to have the largest sales.


Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total dollars? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?

In order for this to be 'fair', we should remove the sales from 2013 and 2017. For the same reasons as discussed above.

SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
The greatest sales amounts occur in December (12). 

Which year did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all years evenly represented by the dataset?

SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) ord_year,  COUNT(*) total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
Again, 2016 by far has the most amount of orders, but again 2013 and 2017 are not evenly represented to the other years in the dataset.


Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?
SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, COUNT(*) total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
December still has the most sales, but interestingly, November has the second most sales (but not the most dollar sales. To make a fair comparison from one month to another 2017 and 2013 data were removed.

In which month of which year did Walmart spend the most on gloss paper in terms of dollars?
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', o.occurred_at) ord_date, SUM(o.gloss_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o 
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
May 2016 was when Walmart spent the most on gloss paper.

CASE STATEMENTS
We would like to understand 3 different branches of customers based on the amount associated with their purchases. The top branch includes anyone with a Lifetime Value (total sales of all orders) greater than 200,000 usd. The second branch is between 200,000 and 100,000 usd. The lowest branch is anyone under 100,000 usd. Provide a table that includes the level associated with each account. You should provide the account name, the total sales of all orders for the customer, and the level. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

SELECT a.name, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent, 
     CASE WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top'
     WHEN  SUM(total_amt_usd) > 100000 THEN 'middle'
     ELSE 'low' END AS customer_level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id 
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
We would now like to perform a similar calculation to the first, but we want to obtain the total amount spent by customers only in 2016 and 2017. Keep the same levels as in the previous question. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

SELECT a.name, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_spent, 
     CASE WHEN SUM(total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top'
     WHEN  SUM(total_amt_usd) > 100000 THEN 'middle'
     ELSE 'low' END AS customer_level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE occurred_at > '2015-12-31' 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, and a column with top or not depending on if they have more than 200 orders. Place the top sales people first in your final table.
SELECT s.name, COUNT(*) num_ords,
     CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 THEN 'top'
     ELSE 'not' END AS sales_rep_level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id 
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
It is worth mentioning that this assumes each name is unique - which has been done a few times. We otherwise would want to break by the name and the id of the table.

The previous didn't account for the middle, nor the dollar amount associated with the sales. Management decides they want to see these characteristics represented as well. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders or more than 750000 in total sales. The middle group has any rep with more than 150 orders or 500000 in sales. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, total sales across all orders, and a column with top, middle, or low depending on this criteria. Place the top sales people based on dollar amount of sales first in your final table.
SELECT s.name, COUNT(*), SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent, 
     CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 750000 THEN 'top'
     WHEN COUNT(*) > 150 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 500000 THEN 'middle'
     ELSE 'low' END AS sales_rep_level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id 
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC;





Solution: Subquery Mania
Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.

First, I wanted to find the total_amt_usd totals associated with each sales rep, and I also wanted the region in which they were located. The query below provided this information.
SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
Next, I pulled the max for each region, and then we can use this to pull those rows in our final result.
SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1;
Essentially, this is a JOIN of these two tables, where the region and amount match.
SELECT t3.rep_name, t3.region_name, t3.total_amt
FROM(SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1) t2
JOIN (SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
     FROM sales_reps s
     JOIN accounts a
     ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
     JOIN orders o
     ON o.account_id = a.id
     JOIN region r
     ON r.id = s.region_id
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) t3
ON t3.region_name = t2.region_name AND t3.total_amt = t2.total_amt;
For the region with the largest sales total_amt_usd, how many total orders were placed? 

The first query I wrote was to pull the total_amt_usd for each region.
SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name;
Then we just want the region with the max amount from this table. There are two ways I considered getting this amount. One was to pull the max using a subquery. Another way is to order descending and just pull the top value.
SELECT MAX(total_amt)
FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY r.name) sub;
Finally, we want to pull the total orders for the region with this amount:
SELECT r.name, COUNT(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (
      SELECT MAX(total_amt)
      FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
              FROM sales_reps s
              JOIN accounts a
              ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
              JOIN orders o
              ON o.account_id = a.id
              JOIN region r
              ON r.id = s.region_id
              GROUP BY r.name) sub);
This provides the Northeast with 2357 orders.

For the account that purchased the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) standard_qty paper, how many accounts still had more in total purchases? 

First, we want to find the account that had the most standard_qty paper. The query here pulls that account, as well as the total amount:

SELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
Now, I want to use this to pull all the accounts with more total sales:

SELECT a.name
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total 
                  FROM (SELECT a.name act_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) tot_std, SUM(o.total) total
                        FROM accounts a
                        JOIN orders o
                        ON o.account_id = a.id
                        GROUP BY 1
                        ORDER BY 2 DESC
                        LIMIT 1) sub);
--This is now a list of all the accounts with more total orders. We can get the count with just another simple subquery.

SELECT COUNT(*)

      GROUP BY 1
      HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total

                        FROM accounts a
                        JOIN orders o
                        ON o.account_id = a.id
                        GROUP BY 1
                        ORDER BY 2 DESC

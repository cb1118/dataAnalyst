#   The changes year over year are significant for these countries.  However, the plot indicates that these changes could be related to how the
#   reporting is being done vs. actual changes.  Countries such as Tuvalu, Saudi Arabia & Ireland show drastic changes in a short period of time and then a period
#   of consistency.  This indicates that how data was reported changed or the definition of agricultural land was changed and it impacted those countries more
#   than others.  Of the counrties plotted, Comoros, Paraguay and Puerto Rico showed the most consistent trends.

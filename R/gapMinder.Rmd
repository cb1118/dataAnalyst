## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r agricultural land}
#Read CSV file ["Country" column name was set in Excel when data was converted to CSV]
pfo <- read.csv('agriculture_land_o.csv', header=T,  check.names = F, sep=",", quote="\"", row.names=NULL)
#Drop columns with no data
pfo <- pfo[ , !names(pfo) %in% c("1960","2010","2011")]
```




```{r}
#Add averages by year for all countries combined
#Gen DF containing averages by year
pftmp <- data.frame(colMeans(pfo[, -1], na.rm = TRUE))
#Transpose the data frame so that the years become columns
pftmp <- data.frame(t(pftmp),check.names=FALSE)
#add the Country column and bind it to the original DF
pftmp[["Country"]] <- "Average_All"
pfo <- rbind(pfo,pftmp)

#Reset the row names
rownames(pfo) <- NULL

#Release the pftmp df
rm(pftmp)
```


```{r Calc differences}
#Create data frame to show countries which have had the most significant changes since 1969 (40 years)
# and 1999 (10 years)

#Create initial data frame with just Country data
pfd <- data.frame(pfo$Country, check.names=FALSE)
colnames(pfd)[1]  <- "Country"

#Generate 40 year differences and add to DF
pfd$"1969" <-pfo$"2009" - pfo$"1969"

#Generate 10 year differences and add to DF
pfd$"1999" <- pfo$"2009" - pfo$"1999"


```

```{r plot prep}

#Gather data for plotting
pfx=gather(pfo,year,pct.ag.land,-Country)
#Removing null values.  This will also remove a few countries that have no date present in the data set
pfx <- na.omit(pfx)

#Output summary data
summary(pfx)

#Make sure year is numeric
pfx$year <- as.numeric(pfx$year)

```


```{r}
#More plotting prep: Generate list of top 10 counties based on highest variance over the years
pfv <-data.frame(tapply(pfx$pct.ag.land, pfx$Country, var, na.rm=TRUE))
colnames(pfv)[1]<-"Variance"
pfv$Variance <- as.double(pfv$Variance) 

#convert the rownames to columns
pfv <- rownames_to_column(pfv, var = "Country")

#Reduce data from to top 10 values
pfv_lg <- filter(pfv,row_number(desc(pfv$Variance))<=10)
#Output data frame
pfv_lg

#Comments on data set:  We see a very significant level of variance in the top 10 countries.  Definitely someething we want to plot to get a better view of the changes.
```

  ## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r largest by population}
#Top 10 countries by population.  List was compiled through internet search
pf_avg <- subset(pfx, Country %in% c("Average_All","China","India","United States","Indonesia","Brazil","Pakistan","Nigeria","Bangladesh","Russia","Japan"))


#Plot the country data along with the average
ggplot(pf_avg, aes(x=year, y=pct.ag.land, color=Country))  + 
  geom_line(size=2) +
  ylab("Agricultural Land(%)") +
  xlab("Year") +
  theme_dark() +
  ggtitle("Percent of Total Land Used for Agriculture: 1961 - 2009") 
ggsave("Top10_Countries_By_Pop.png")

#Comments on plot of data:
#   China had the most significant growth (~20%) for the period of time covered by the data but that growth has leveled off since 1990.
#   Two of the most modern and advanced countries, United Stated and Japan have steadily declined since 1961
#   Bangladesh had a sudden and very large decreasing in ag land usage between 1991 and 1992.  THis is a area where more research is needed.
#   Nigeria has a very large percentage of land used for agriculture but that percentage started showing a sharp decline at the end of the 
#         data available. THis is another area to do further research
#   For all countries combined, there is slow, but steady growth year over year.

#Comments on plot
#   The changes year over year are significant for these countries.  However, the plot indicates that these changes could be related to how the 
#   reporting is being done vs. actual changes.  Countries such as Tuvalu, Saudi Arabia & Ireland show drastic changes in a short period of time and then a period 
#   of consistency.  This indicates that how data was reported changed or the definition of agricultural land was changed and it impacted those countries more 
#   than others.  Of the counrties plotted, Comoros, Paraguay and Puerto Rico showed the most consistent trends.

#COmments on Plot:
#  THere is a fairly equal distribution of increases vs decreases in the 40 year view.
#  However, in the 10 year view we are seeing a higher percentage of countries decreasing ag land vs increasing.  The trend towards a decrease
#  does not align with the world average which is steadily decreasing.   

```
```{r}
#Overall comments:
# It was a very interesting exercise to explore this data.  There were some surpises in the data but also some suspect or potentially innaccurate data 
# which needs to be analyzed further.

# It should be noted that there appears to have been a change in reporting in the early 1990s which impacted a number of countries.  This should be explored further.

# To fully analyze this data, it would be very beneficial to overlay the data with significant geo-political events which may have impacted individual countries.  
#  Other variables, such as GDP and actual agricultural production would be interesting to review.  i.e. Does decreasing land use equate to decreasing production?
#  What about the value of what is being produced?  In doing some reasearch, the Netherlands, which is a small country with decreasing ag land use, is consistently 
#  amongst the high agricultural producers in terms of value -- THis is a result of high value products, such as flowers.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

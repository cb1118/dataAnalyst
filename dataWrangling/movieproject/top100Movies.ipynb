It features special effects by [[Carlo Rambaldi]] and [[Dennis Muren]], and stars [[Henry Thomas]], [[Dee Wallace]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Robert MacNaughton]], [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Pat Welsh (actress)|Pat Welsh]]. It tells the story of Elliott (Thomas), a lonely boy who befriends an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], dubbed \"E.T.\", who is stranded on Earth. Elliott and his siblings help E.T. return to his home planet, while attempting to keep him hidden from their mother and the government.\\n\\nThe concept was based on an imaginary friend Spielberg created after his parents\\' divorce in 1960. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the stalled sci-fi horror film project \\'\\'[[Night Skies]]\\'\\'. It was filmed from September to December 1981 in [[California]] on a budget of $10.5{{nbsp}}million USD. Unlike most films, it was shot in rough chronological order, to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast.\\n\\nReleased on June 11, 1982, by [[Universal Pictures]], \\'\\'E.T.\\'\\' was an immediate [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], surpassing \\'\\'[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]\\'\\' to become the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]]âa record it held for eleven years until \\'\\'[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]\\'\\', another Spielberg-directed film, surpassed it in 1993.

In 1994, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was re-released in 1985, and then again in 2002, to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots and additional scenes.\\n\\n==Plot==\\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be 400â700 words. -->\\nWhile visiting [[Earth]] in a California forest at night, a group of alien botanists land in a spacecraft. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving one of their own behind in their haste. At a suburban home in the [[San Fernando Valley]], a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family\\'s disbelief, Elliott leaves [[Reese\\'s Pieces]] candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its [[planetary system]] and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead [[chrysanthemum]]s.\\n\\n[[File:ET Communicator Cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Makeshift communicator used by E.T. to phone home. Among its parts is a [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]], an umbrella lined with tinfoil, and a coffee can filled with other electronics.]]\\n\\nAt school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because it is at his home, drinking beer), and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches [[John Wayne]] kiss [[Maureen O\\'Hara]] in \\'\\'[[The Quiet Man]]\\'\\' on television, Elliott then kisses a girl he likes in the same manner and he is sent to the principal\\'s office.\\n\\nThe alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches \\'\\'[[Sesame Street]]\\'\\' and, at Elliott\\'s urging, dubs itself \"E.T.\" E.T. reads a comic strip where [[Buck Rogers]], stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device and is inspired to try it himself. E.T. receives Elliott\\'s help in building a device to \"phone home\" by using a [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]] toy. Michael notices that E.T.\\'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as \"we\".\\n\\nOn [[Halloween]], Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a successful call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son\\'s illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, [[resurrection|coming back to life]]. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael\\'s friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.\\n\\nStanding near the spaceship, E.T.\\'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and \"Keys\", a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he tells Elliott \"I\\'ll be right here\", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott\\'s forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.\\n\\n==Cast==\\n* [[Dee Wallace]] as Mary\\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as Elliott\\n* [[Peter Coyote]] as \"Keys\"\\n* [[Robert MacNaughton]] as Michael\\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Gertie\\n* [[Pat Welsh (actress)|Pat Welsh]] as the voice of E.T.\\n* [[K.

On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia Pictures CEO [[Frank Price]] passed on the project, calling it \"a wimpy [[Walt Disney]] movie\" and thus putting it in a [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], so Spielberg approached the more receptive [[Sid Sheinberg]], president of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], the then-parent company of [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]].<ref>{{Cite news| first = Deborah | last = Caulfield | title = E.T.

Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the animatronics. [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship\\'s design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with [[walkie-talkie]]s.<ref name=\"20edition\"/>\\n\\nAt the premiere, John Williams conducted a live performance of the score.<ref>{{cite video | title = Live at the Shrine!

It tells the story of Elliott (Thomas), a lonely boy who befriends an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], dubbed &quot;E.T.&quot;, who is stranded on Earth. Elliott and his siblings help E.T. return to his home planet, while attempting to keep him hidden from their mother and the government.\\n\\nThe concept was based on an imaginary friend Spielberg created after his parents\\' divorce in 1960. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the stalled sci-fi horror film project \\'\\'[[Night Skies]]\\'\\'. It was filmed from September to December 1981 in [[California]] on a budget of $10.5<template><title>nbsp</title></template>million USD.

When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving one of their own behind in their haste. At a suburban home in the [[San Fernando Valley]], a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family\\'s disbelief, Elliott leaves [[Reese\\'s Pieces]] candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its [[planetary system]] and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead [[chrysanthemum]]s.\\n\\n[[File:ET Communicator Cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Makeshift communicator used by E.T. to phone home. Among its parts is a [[Speak &amp; Spell (toy)|Speak &amp; Spell]], an umbrella lined with tinfoil, and a coffee can filled with other electronics.]]\\n\\nAt school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because it is at his home, drinking beer), and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches [[John Wayne]] kiss [[Maureen O\\'Hara]] in \\'\\'[[The Quiet Man]]\\'\\' on television, Elliott then kisses a girl he likes in the same manner and he is sent to the principal\\'s office.\\n\\nThe alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches \\'\\'[[Sesame Street]]\\'\\' and, at Elliott\\'s urging, dubs itself &quot;E.T.&quot; E.T. reads a comic strip where [[Buck Rogers]], stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device and is inspired to try it himself. E.T. receives Elliott\\'s help in building a device to &quot;phone home&quot; by using a [[Speak &amp; Spell (toy)|Speak &amp; Spell]] toy. Michael notices that E.T.\\'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as &quot;we&quot;.\\n\\nOn [[Halloween]], Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a successful call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son\\'s illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, [[resurrection|coming back to life]]. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael\\'s friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.\\n\\nStanding near the spaceship, E.T.\\'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and &quot;Keys&quot;, a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he tells Elliott &quot;I\\'ll be right here&quot;, pointing his glowing finger to Elliott\\'s forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.\\n\\n<h level=\"2\" i=\"2\">==Cast==</h>\\n* [[Dee Wallace]] as Mary\\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as Elliott\\n* [[Peter Coyote]] as &quot;Keys&quot;\\n* [[Robert MacNaughton]] as Michael\\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Gertie\\n* [[Pat Welsh (actress)|Pat Welsh]] as the voice of E.T.\\n* [[K.

Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the animatronics. [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), provided by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship\\'s design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with [[walkie-talkie]]s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;20edition&quot;</attr></ext>\\n\\nAt the premiere, John Williams conducted a live performance of the score.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite video | title = Live at the Shrine!

The film was ranked by many critics as the best film of 2015, and is considered one of the greatest action films of all time and one of the greatest films of the 21st century, praised for its direction, screenplay, action sequences, and ensemble cast. <i>Fury Road</i> won multiple critical and guild awards, and received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won six: Costume Design, Production Design, Makeup and Hairstyling, Film Editing, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing.\\n</p>',\n",

Miller collaborated with [[Brendan McCarthy]] and [[Nico Lathouris]] on the [[screenplay]]. The fourth {{not a typo|installment}} and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]<ref name=\"Filming1\" /> of the [[Mad Max (franchise)|\\'\\'Mad Max\\'\\' franchise]], it is a joint Australian-American<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/5553f6745dee3|title=Mad Max Fury Road (2015)|work=BFI}}</ref> venture produced by [[Kennedy Miller Mitchell]], [[RatPac-Dune Entertainment]], and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]]. The film is set in a [[post-apocalyptic]] desert wasteland where petrol and water are scarce commodities. It follows [[Max Rockatansky]] ([[Tom Hardy]]), who joins forces with [[Imperator Furiosa]] ([[Charlize Theron]]) to flee from cult leader Immortan Joe ([[Hugh Keays-Byrne]]) and his army in an armoured tanker truck, leading to a lengthy road battle. The film also features [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]], [[Riley Keough]], [[ZoÃ« Kravitz]], [[Abbey Lee Kershaw|Abbey Lee]], and [[Courtney Eaton]].\\n\\n\\'\\'Fury Road\\'\\' was in [[development hell]] for many years, with [[pre-production]] starting as early as 1997. Attempts to shoot the film in 2001 and 2003 were delayed due to the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[Iraq War]]. In 2007, after focusing on \\'\\'[[Happy Feet]]\\'\\', Miller decided to pursue it again. He briefly considered producing it as a computer-animated film but abandoned it in favour of live-action. In 2009, Miller announced that filming would begin in early 2011. Hardy was cast as Max in June 2010, with production planned to begin that November. Principal photography was delayed several more times before beginning in July 2012. The film [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in December 2012, although additional footage was shot in November 2013.\\n\\nThe world premiere was on 7 May 2015 at the [[Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre|TCL Chinese Theatre]]. It began a worldwide theatrical release on 14 May 2015, including an out-of-competition screening at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival|68th Cannes Film Festival]], in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]]. It has grossed over $378 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the \\'\\'Mad Max\\'\\' franchise. The film was ranked by many critics as the best film of 2015, and is considered one of the [[List of films considered the best#Action|greatest action films of all time]] and one of the greatest films of the 21st century,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/mad-max-fury-road-one-of-the-greatest-action-films-of-all-time-here-are-the-top-12-according-to-10254063.html | title=\\'\\'Mad Max: Fury Road\\'\\': One of the Greatest Action Films of All Time? | work=[[The Independent]] | date=2015 |access-date=28 March 2017}}</ref> praised for its direction, screenplay, action sequences, and ensemble cast. \\'\\'Fury Road\\'\\' won multiple critical and guild awards, and received ten [[Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won six: [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Production Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Makeup and Hairstyling]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Sound Mixing]].\\n\\n== Plot ==\\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be 400 to 700 words.

[[Max <!--- Max\\'s full name is stated in the film. Please consult the talk page before removing his surname --->Rockatansky]], a survivor, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and taken to Joe\\'s Citadel. Designated a [[universal blood donor]], Max is imprisoned and used as a \"blood bag\" for a sick War Boy called [[Nux (Mad Max character)|Nux]]. Meanwhile, [[Imperator Furiosa]], one of Joe\\'s lieutenants, is sent in her armoured semi-truck, the \"War Rig\", to collect gasoline. When she drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wivesâwomen selected for breedingâare missing, and fleeing with her. Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.\\n\\nNux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. A battle ensues between the War Rig and Joe\\'s forces. Furiosa drives into a [[sand storm]], evading her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed. After the storm, Max finds Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by the wives: Capable, Cheedo, Toast, the Dag, and the Splendid Angharad, who is heavily pregnant with Joe\\'s child. Max steals the Rig, but its [[kill switch]] disables it. Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the wives accompany him; Nux climbs on the Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill Furiosa, but is overcome and thrown out, and is picked up by Joe\\'s army.\\n\\nFuriosa drives through a [[biker gang]]-controlled [[canyon]] to barter a deal for safe passage. However, with Joe\\'s forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, forcing her and the group to flee, while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe. Max and Furiosa fight pursuing bikers as Joe\\'s car, with Nux now on board, breaks through the blockade and eventually attacks the War Rig, allowing Nux to board. However, as the Rig escapes, Angharad falls off in an attempt to protect Max and is run over by Joe\\'s car, killing her and her child. Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the \"Green Place\", an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig, distraught over his failure, and consoles him. That night, the Rig gets stuck in the mud. Furiosa and Max slow Joe\\'s forces with mines, but Joe\\'s ally, the Bullet Farmer, continues pursuing them. Nux helps Max free the Rig while Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer. Max walks into the dark to confront the Bullet Farmer and his men, returning with guns and ammunition.\\n\\nThey drive the War Rig overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. Max suspects a trap, though Furiosa approaches the woman and states her history and clan affiliation. The naked woman summons her clan, the Vuvalini, who recognize Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the Green Place, now uninhabitable. The group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] in the hope of finding a new home. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save,<!---Debate: the comics state that the child is not Max\\'s daughter, but the video game states that she is his step-daughter.---> he convinces them to return to the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army in the bikers\\' canyon.\\n\\nThe group heads back to the Citadel, but they are attacked en route by Joe\\'s forces, and Furiosa is seriously wounded. Joe positions his car in front of the War Rig to slow it, while Max fights Joe\\'s giant son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures Toast, who manages to distract him long enough for Furiosa to kill him. Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the surviving Vuvalini to escape in Joe\\'s car, where Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life.\\n\\nAt the Citadel, the impoverished citizens react to Joe\\'s death with joy. Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the remaining War Boys.

The film is set in a [[post-apocalyptic]] desert wasteland where petrol and water are scarce commodities. It follows [[Max Rockatansky]] ([[Tom Hardy]]), who joins forces with [[Imperator Furiosa]] ([[Charlize Theron]]) to flee from cult leader Immortan Joe ([[Hugh Keays-Byrne]]) and his army in an armoured tanker truck, leading to a lengthy road battle. The film also features [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]], [[Riley Keough]], [[ZoÃ« Kravitz]], [[Abbey Lee Kershaw|Abbey Lee]], and [[Courtney Eaton]].\\n\\n\\'\\'Fury Road\\'\\' was in [[development hell]] for many years, with [[pre-production]] starting as early as 1997. Attempts to shoot the film in 2001 and 2003 were delayed due to the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[Iraq War]]. In 2007, after focusing on \\'\\'[[Happy Feet]]\\'\\', Miller decided to pursue it again. He briefly considered producing it as a computer-animated film but abandoned it in favour of live-action. In 2009, Miller announced that filming would begin in early 2011. Hardy was cast as Max in June 2010, with production planned to begin that November. Principal photography was delayed several more times before beginning in July 2012. The film [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in December 2012, although additional footage was shot in November 2013.\\n\\nThe world premiere was on 7 May 2015 at the [[Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre|TCL Chinese Theatre]].

Please consult the talk page before removing his surname ---&gt;</comment>Rockatansky]], a survivor, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and taken to Joe\\'s Citadel. Designated a [[universal blood donor]], Max is imprisoned and used as a &quot;blood bag&quot; for a sick War Boy called [[Nux (Mad Max character)|Nux]]. Meanwhile, [[Imperator Furiosa]], one of Joe\\'s lieutenants, is sent in her armoured semi-truck, the &quot;War Rig&quot;, to collect gasoline. When she drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wivesâwomen selected for breedingâare missing, and fleeing with her. Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.\\n\\nNux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. A battle ensues between the War Rig and Joe\\'s forces. Furiosa drives into a [[sand storm]], evading her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed. After the storm, Max finds Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by the wives: Capable, Cheedo, Toast, the Dag, and the Splendid Angharad, who is heavily pregnant with Joe\\'s child. Max steals the Rig, but its [[kill switch]] disables it. Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the wives accompany him; Nux climbs on the Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill Furiosa, but is overcome and thrown out, and is picked up by Joe\\'s army.\\n\\nFuriosa drives through a [[biker gang]]-controlled [[canyon]] to barter a deal for safe passage. However, with Joe\\'s forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, forcing her and the group to flee, while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe. Max and Furiosa fight pursuing bikers as Joe\\'s car, with Nux now on board, breaks through the blockade and eventually attacks the War Rig, allowing Nux to board. However, as the Rig escapes, Angharad falls off in an attempt to protect Max and is run over by Joe\\'s car, killing her and her child. Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the &quot;Green Place&quot;, an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig, distraught over his failure, and consoles him. That night, the Rig gets stuck in the mud. Furiosa and Max slow Joe\\'s forces with mines, but Joe\\'s ally, the Bullet Farmer, continues pursuing them. Nux helps Max free the Rig while Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer. Max walks into the dark to confront the Bullet Farmer and his men, returning with guns and ammunition.\\n\\nThey drive the War Rig overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. Max suspects a trap, though Furiosa approaches the woman and states her history and clan affiliation. The naked woman summons her clan, the Vuvalini, who recognize Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the Green Place, now uninhabitable. The group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] in the hope of finding a new home. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save,<comment>&lt;!---Debate: the comics state that the child is not Max\\'s daughter, but the video game states that she is his step-daughter.---&gt;</comment> he convinces them to return to the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army in the bikers\\' canyon.\\n\\nThe group heads back to the Citadel, but they are attacked en route by Joe\\'s forces, and Furiosa is seriously wounded. Joe positions his car in front of the War Rig to slow it, while Max fights Joe\\'s giant son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures Toast, who manages to distract him long enough for Furiosa to kill him. Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the surviving Vuvalini to escape in Joe\\'s car, where Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life.\\n\\nAt the Citadel, the impoverished citizens react to Joe\\'s death with joy. Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the remaining War Boys. Max shares a respectful glance with Furiosa before blending into the crowd and again departing for parts unknown.\\n\\n<h level=\"2\" i=\"2\">==Cast==</h>\\n<template lineStart=\"1\"><title>div col</title><part><name>colwidth</name><equals>=</equals><value>30em</value></part></template>\\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as [[Max Rockatansky]]\\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Imperator Furiosa]]\\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Nux (Mad Max character)|Nux]]\\n* [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]] as Immortan Joe\\n* [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]] as The Splendid Angharad\\n* [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] as Rictus Erectus\\n* [[Riley Keough]] as Capable\\n* [[ZoÃ« Kravitz]] as Toast the Knowing\\n* [[Abbey Lee Kershaw|Abbey Lee]] as The Dag\\n* [[Courtney Eaton]] as Cheedo the Fragile\\n* [[Josh Helman]] as Slit\\n* [[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]] as The People Eater\\n* [[Richard Carter (actor)|Richard Carter]] as The Bullet Farmer\\n* [[Angus Sampson]] as The Organic Mechanic\\n* [[Iota (singer)|iOTA]] as The Doof Warrior\\n* [[Megan Gale]] as The Valkyrie\\n* [[Melissa Jaffer]] as Keeper of the Seeds\\n* Melita Jurisic, [[Gillian Jones]], [[Joy Smithers]], Antoinette Kellerman, and Christina Koch as The Vuvalini\\n* Quentin Kenihan as Corpus Colossus\\n* Jon Iles as The Ace\\n<template lineStart=\"1\"><title>div col end</title></template>\\n\\n<h level=\"2\" i=\"3\">==Themes and analysis==</h>\\n<h level=\"3\" i=\"4\">===Survival===</h>\\nThe primary theme of \\'\\'Mad Max: Fury Road\\'\\' is survival and retention of humanity in the face of apocalyptic events.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news|last1=Semley|first1=John|title=Thirty years later, Mad Max\\'s vision of our postapocalypse feels more prescient than ever|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/thirty-years-later-mad-maxs-vision-of-our-postapocalypse-feels-more-prescient-than-ever/article24433410/|website=[[The Globe and Mail]]|publisher=Phillip Crawley|access-date=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519164053/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/thirty-years-later-mad-maxs-vision-of-our-postapocalypse-feels-more-prescient-than-ever/article24433410/|archivedate=19 May 2015|date=14 May 2015}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|last1=Lawson|first1=Richard|title=Mad Max: Fury Road Might Be the Best Thing You See This Summer|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road-review|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[CondÃ© Nast]]|access-date=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519164231/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road-review|archivedate=19 May 2015|date=11 May 2015}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The theme of humanity is illustrated by Max beginning the film a feral wanderer, then rediscovering his former dignity by partnering with Furiosa.
